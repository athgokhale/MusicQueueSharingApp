# MusicQueueSharingApp
An app that allows a user to connect their music streaming service, open a room, and share the room with their friends. Anyone connected to the room can add / remove songs from the shared queue. 

This app will use Django as the backend, React / Redux for frontend, and DynamoDB as storage layer.
